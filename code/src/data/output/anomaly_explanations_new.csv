2,Country,"The combination of City 'New York' and Country 'CA' (Canada) is unusual. New York is a city in the US, not Canada. This suggests a data entry error in the Country or City field."
15,MaturityDate,"The Maturity Date ('2021-09-25') is before the Origination Date ('2023-03-30'). This is illogical, as a loan cannot mature before it is originated. This indicates a date entry error."
37,MaturityDate,"The Maturity Date ('2022-12-15') is before the NonAccrualDate ('2022-12-15'). While the dates are equal, it's unlikely, and generally, the NonAccrualDate should be after the Maturity Date. This might indicate an issue with the loan performance or data entry."
40,Country,"The combination of City 'Houston' and Country 'FR' (France) is unusual. Houston is a city in the US, not France. This suggests a data entry error in the Country or City field."
62,NonAccrualDate,"The NonAccrualDate ('2023-03-30') is after the MaturityDate ('2022-12-15'). A loan typically goes into non-accrual status before or at maturity, but not significantly after. This could indicate a data entry error or a specific agreement."
82,MaturityDate,"The Maturity Date ('2022-12-15') is before the Origination Date ('2023-03-30'). This is illogical, as a loan cannot mature before it is originated. This indicates a date entry error."
252,MaturityDate,"The Maturity Date ('2021-09-25') is before the Origination Date ('2022-12-15'). This is illogical, as a loan cannot mature before it is originated. This indicates a date entry error."
317,UtilizedExposure,"The Utilized Exposure ('41662218') is significantly lower than the Committed Exposure ('93028084'). While not inherently wrong, a large difference like this, especially with a high Committed Exposure, warrants investigation. It might indicate underutilization of the credit facility or a recent significant repayment."
365,UtilizedExposure,"The Utilized Exposure ('15531984') is significantly lower than the Committed Exposure ('98738102'). While not inherently wrong, a large difference like this, especially with a high Committed Exposure, warrants investigation. It might indicate underutilization of the credit facility or a recent significant repayment."
391,MaturityDate,"The Maturity Date ('2022-12-15') is before the Origination Date ('2023-03-30'). This is illogical, as a loan cannot mature before it is originated. This indicates a date entry error."
426,UtilizedExposure,"The Utilized Exposure ('94563671') is significantly higher than the Committed Exposure ('20060006'). This is unusual as typically the utilized exposure should not exceed the committed exposure. It could indicate an overdrawn facility, a data entry error, or a specific agreement allowing for temporary over-commitment."
436,InterestRateCeiling,"The Interest Rate Ceiling ('2.09') is lower than the Interest Rate ('10.1'). This violates the definition of an interest rate ceiling, which should be the maximum possible interest rate. This clearly indicates a data error."
440,OriginationDate,"The NonAccrualDate ('2021-09-25') is before the OriginationDate ('2021-09-25'). While the dates are equal, it's unlikely, and generally, the NonAccrualDate should be after the OriginationDate. This might indicate an issue with the loan performance or data entry."
442,InterestRateIndex,"The Interest Rate Index ('10.37') is higher than the Interest Rate ('9.36'). This is unusual, as the actual interest rate would normally be derived from the index (plus a spread). This suggests a potential data entry error or a specific, unusual agreement."
