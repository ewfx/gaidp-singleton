While possible, it raises suspicion, especially given the large 'CommittedExposure'. This is not necessarily wrong, but unusual and worth investigating."
6,MaturityDate,"The 'MaturityDate' (2022-12-15) is the same as the 'OriginationDate' (2022-12-15), which means the facility has a zero-day maturity. This is highly unusual and likely an error.  Facilities are generally for some duration of time."
