2,Country,"The combination of 'City' as 'New York' and 'Country' as 'CA' (Canada) is highly unusual. New York is a city in the US, not Canada. This suggests a data entry error. Also, the MaturityDate is before OriginationDate, which is not possible."
6,MaturityDate,"The 'MaturityDate' is the same as the 'OriginationDate' (2022-12-15). Credit facilities typically have a duration longer than zero days. This is highly unusual and suggests a data entry error. Furthermore, IndustryCodeType (5221) differs from IndustryCode (551111) which is suspicious."
50,NetSalesCurrent,"NetSalesCurrent is negative (-10000), which is highly improbable for a company. It may represent a loss or correction, but such a large negative value warrants investigation. Also, Country is CA (Canada) but City is New York which is unusual."
86,Country,"The combination of 'City' as 'San Francisco' and 'Country' as 'UK' (United Kingdom) is highly unusual. San Francisco is a city in the US, not the UK. This suggests a data entry error. Further, TotalAssetsCurrent is significantly higher than TotalAssetsPriorYear, which indicates a significant change in the company's assets, possibly due to an acquisition or other major event. However, the DateFinancials and DateLastAudit are the same."
87,MaturityDate,"The 'MaturityDate' (2021-09-25) is before the 'OriginationDate' (2023-03-30). A credit facility cannot mature before it originates. This indicates a data entry error. Also, Country is DE (Germany) but City is Los Angeles which is unusual."
122,CurrentLiabilitiesPriorYear,"The 'CurrentLiabilitiesCurrent' is significantly lower than 'CurrentLiabilitiesPriorYear', which may indicate a substantial change in the company's financial structure, possibly due to a restructuring or debt repayment. Also, the IndustryCodeType (551111) differs significantly from the IndustryCode (1111) which raises concern. Furthermore, the MaturityDate and OriginationDate are the same."
179,OperatingIncome,"The 'NetSalesCurrent' and 'OperatingIncome' have the same large value of 5000000, which is highly unusual. Such precise matching and large values suggest potential data manipulation or error. Also, Country is DE (Germany) but City is Los Angeles which is unusual. Furthermore, Tangible Assets is 10, which is very low compared to FixedAssets."
184,TotalAssetsCurrent,"The 'TotalAssetsCurrent' is significantly lower than 'TotalAssetsPriorYear', which may indicate a substantial change in the company's financial structure. Also, TotalAssetsCurrent is very low compared to CurrentAssetsCurrent and TangibleAssets. Furthermore, the NonAccrualDate is null, which means the loan is performing, but the PastDue is quite high."
275,CurrentLiabilitiesPriorYear,"The 'CurrentLiabilitiesCurrent' is significantly lower than 'CurrentLiabilitiesPriorYear', which may indicate a substantial change in the company's financial structure, possibly due to a restructuring or debt repayment. Also, TotalAssetsCurrent is very low compared to CurrentAssetsCurrent and TangibleAssets."
283,MaturityDate,"The 'MaturityDate' (2021-09-25) is before the 'OriginationDate' (2023-03-30). A credit facility cannot mature before it originates. This indicates a data entry error. Also, Country is DE (Germany) but City is Los Angeles which is unusual."
295,TotalAssetsPriorYear,"The 'TotalAssetsCurrent' is significantly higher than 'TotalAssetsPriorYear'. This may indicate a substantial change in the company's financial structure, possibly due to an acquisition or other major event. Also, TotalLiabilities is very high compared to TotalAssetsCurrent. Furthermore, DateFinancials (2021-09-25) is before DateLastAudit (2022-12-15)."
387,NetSalesCurrent,"The 'NetSalesCurrent' is very low (136) compared to 'NetSalesPriorYear'(1637). Also, the 'TotalAssetsCurrent' is significantly higher than 'TotalAssetsPriorYear'. This may indicate a substantial change in the company's financial structure, possibly due to an acquisition or other major event."
402,UtilizedExposure,"The 'UtilizedExposure' is significantly lower than 'CommittedExposure'. This is not necessarily an anomaly by itself, but the large difference raises a flag. Also, the 'TotalAssetsCurrent' is significantly higher than 'TotalAssetsPriorYear'. This may indicate a substantial change in the company's financial structure, possibly due to an acquisition or other major event."
435,NetSalesCurrent,"The 'NetSalesCurrent' is very low (10) compared to 'NetSalesPriorYear'(2639). OperatingIncome is also negative (-10000). Also, Country is FR (France) but City is Houston which is unusual. Furthermore, Tangible Assets is 10, which is very low compared to FixedAssets."
455,TotalAssetsCurrent,"The 'TotalAssetsCurrent' is significantly lower than 'TotalAssetsPriorYear'. This may indicate a substantial change in the company's financial structure, possibly due to an asset sale or other major event. Also, Country is UK (United Kingdom) but City is Los Angeles which is unusual."
